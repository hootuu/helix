# helix
Helix​ is a resilient Go framework that abstracts infrastructure complexities for modern service architectures. Inspired by spiral stability, it streamlines core concerns like configuration management, service discovery, distributed tracing, and observability.

Here's a streamlined README.md template for Helix. I'll follow with a code block containing the full markdown content:


Helix abstracts infrastructure complexities for Go service architectures, offering production-validated essentials:
- 🔧 Configuration management (env vars, files, secrets)
- 🔍 Service discovery & health monitoring
- 📊 Built-in metrics (Prometheus) & structured logging (Zap)
- 🕵️ Distributed tracing & observability
- 🧩 Pluggable middleware architecture

## 🚀 Installation
```bash
go get github.com/yourorg/helix@latest
```

## ⚡ Quick Start
```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/yourorg/helix/core"
    "github.com/yourorg/helix/plugins/http"
)

func main() {
    service := helix.NewService(
        helix.WithName("my-service"),
        helix.WithHTTP(http.NewServer(8080)),
    )
    
    service.Start()
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration
Helix automatically loads configurations from:
1. `config.yaml` in working directory
2. Environment variables (HELIX_* prefix)
3. Command-line flags

```yaml
# config.yaml
logging:
  level: debug
  format: json

metrics:
  prometheus:
    enable: true
    port: 9090
```
